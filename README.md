This is for windows. I tried to put it in a script but it didn't work.
```sh
wget https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.3.9/glfw-3.3.9.bin.WIN64.zip -o lib/glfw.zip
tar -xf .\lib\glfw.zip
mv glfw-3.3.9.bin.WIN64 lib/glfw
```
You will also need to download the latest GLEW and put it in the folder `lib/glew`
